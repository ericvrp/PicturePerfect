# PicturePerfect

Goal of this project is to create an extremely simple and limited yet rewarding interface for viewing online photo albums.

Our target audience (kids, handicapped, elderly) should be shielded from accidental confusing screen with things like settings, urls, bookmarks, etc.. That is why this webapp can best be viewed in a fullscreen browser that prefends these distractions as much as possible. On iOS the Frameless and Browsy browsers look interesting.
